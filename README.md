# ShoulderSurfing #
Fork of [ShoulderSurfing](https://github.com/Exopandora/ShoulderSurfing), mainly for use w my mod [Prehistoric Rift](https://github.com/ANightDazingZoroark/Prehistoric-Rift-Mod). Has a bunch of edits to the original mod for use w Prehistoric Rift, such as dynamic aiming while riding a mob that has a ranged attack. I might also end up expanding this aforementioned feature to make it work with Ice and Fire, Lycanites Mobs, etc, basically anything with a mountable entity w a controlled ranged attack.
